## Where do I get UWPX from and how do I install it?
There are two ways how you can get UWP:

### Microsoft Store

### Installation (build it by your own)
1. Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/de/downloads)
2. Clone the repo with Visual Studio
3. Build the project for your target platform
4. Install the app on your target system:
[Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) you can find more information about: How to install UWP apps, using the developer mode.

## What kind of account do I need?
Because XMPP is like email a federated protocol (=> there are no "__official__" XMPP accounts), everybody can host his own server providing XMPP accounts.

## Where can I get a account from?
Because XMPP is like email a federated protocol there are two ways of obtaining an XMPP (Jabber) account:
- There are [a bunch](https://list.jabber.at/) of providers which privide __free__ XMPP (Jabber) accounts. Like with your email provider make sure your XMPP provider is [**trustworthy**](https://xmpp.net/). Some Popular choices:
    - [xmpp.jp](https://www.xmpp.jp/signup)
    - [jabber.ru](https://www.jabber.ru/register)
    - [jabber.de](https://www.jabber.de/anmeldung/)
    - [jabber.at](https://jabber.at/account/register/)
    - [404.city](https://404.city/#registration)
- You also can host your own [server](https://xmpp.org/software/servers.html).
- Some email providers also provide you with an XMPP account:
    - [mailbox.org](https://userforum.mailbox.org/knowledge-base/article/was-ist-jabber-xmpp)
    - [dismail](https://dismail.de/)
    - [mail.de](https://mail.de/hilfe/chat-jabber-einstellungen)

## Which devices are supported?
In theory **all UWP devices** that run an Windows 10 build >= `10.0.15063.0` are able to run UWPX.
But because I'm only able to test it on a Windows Phone and a Windows PC these are the only devices the official [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nw16x9jb5wv?ocid=badge) build will run on.

If there are additional devices you tested UWPX on that are able to run UWPX without any problems, let me know and I will add them to the list.
