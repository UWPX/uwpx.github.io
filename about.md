## Special thanks to
This project wouldn't be possible without the great work of all those people working on the libraries used by UWPX. So take a second, head over and take a look at their great work!

* [**Windows Community Toolkit**](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsCommunityToolkit) They provide an awesome collection of helper functions, custom controls and app services.
* [**QRCoder**](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder) An awesome QR-Code library.
* [**Progress Telerik UI for UWP**](https://github.com/telerik/UI-For-UWP) A collection of advanced custom controls.
* [**App Center Crashes/Push**](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppCenter-SDK-DotNet) Allows me to collect crash reports ([UWPX Privacy Policy](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md#crash-reporting)).
* [**HockeySDK for Windows**](https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeySDK-Windows) Allows me to collect crash reports ([UWPX Privacy Policy](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md#crash-reporting)).
* [**libsignal-protocol-pcl**](https://github.com/langboost/libsignal-protocol-pcl) A port of the [libsignal-protocol-java](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java) library for C# UWP.
* [**SQLite-net**](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) The backend for storing all messages, chats and accounts.
* [**KingKili**](https://github.com/KingKili) For introducing me to XMPP and pushing me to make my own app. He also started the work on the [UWPX-Push-Server](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Push-Server).

Also special thanks to all the Alpha (and hopefully soon Beta) testers that reported bugs, made suggestions, supported the development with [donations]({{ "/support/" | absolute_url }}) or just used and tested the app ❤️.
